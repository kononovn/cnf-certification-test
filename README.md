# cnf-certification-test

## Overview
The repository contains a set of test cases that run different test scenarios from [test-network-function](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function) project and verifies if these scenarios behave correctly under different environment conditions.
The cnf-certification-test project based on golang+[ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo) framework. 

Cnf-certification-test project triggers the same test scenario from 
[test-network-function](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function) 
several times using different preconfigured OCP environment. Once triggered test scenario is completed the test case 
process report and verifies that scenarios is completed with the expected result: skip/fail/pass.

## cnf-certification-test
The cnf-certification-test is designed to test [test-network-function](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function) project using pre-installed OCP cluster with version 4.7 and above. In order to be able to test all test scenarios the following requirements should be met:  

Mandatory requirements:
* OCP cluster installed with version >=4.7
* Minimum 2 cnf-workers nodes
* Performance Addon Operator
* Machine-config-operator

Optional:
* Machine config pool
* PTP operator
* SR-IOV operator
* Performance Addon Operator

### Recommended environment:
* 3 master nodes
* 2 cnf-worker nodes
* 1 worker node

#### Environment variables
* `FEATURES` - select the test scenarios that you are going to test, comma separated

#### Available features
The list of available features:
* *networking*

#### Running the tests

Choose the variant that suits you best:

* `make test-features` - will only run tests for the features that were defined in the `FEATURES` variable
* `make test-all` - will run the test suite for all features

#### Pre-configuration

1`make install` - download and install all required dependencies for the cnf-certification-test project

## How to run

Below is an e2e flow example:

1. Clone the project to your local computer - `git clone https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test.git`

2. Change the folder to the project folder - `cd cnf-certification-test`

3. Download and install needed dependencies - `make install`

4. Run all tests - `make test-all`


# cnf-certification-test - How to contribute

The project uses a development method - forking workflow
### The following is a step-by-step example of forking workflow:
1) A developer [forks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork)
   the [cnf-certification-test](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test) project
2) A new local feature branch is created
3) The developer makes changes on the new branch.
4) New commits are created for the changes.
5) The branch gets pushed to the developer's own server-side copy.
6) Changes are tested.
7) The developer opens a pull request(`PR`) from the new branch to
   the [cnf-certification-test](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test).
8) The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into
   the [cnf-certification-test](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test).
